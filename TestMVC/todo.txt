before Tuesday
add jquery library so we can ajax easily because cole is lazy

on Tuesday
do ajax calls to add/get against repository, and delete, and see them come back to default on restart

in the future:

add more details about the presidents so we can do detail vs high level view on the spa
pictures of the presidents in an images folder
